        </header>
        <p class="white-body">
          I am a junior at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles studying
          electrical engineering and chemistry. For as long as I can remember, I have been interested
          in electronics and building things. My
          first project, back in 3rd grade, was a remote controlled car that
          I took apart and turned into a wireless "parent alert system" to help my sister get
          attention when she had the flu. Though it was later abused and mysteriously disappeared,
          it set the stage for much of the work I've done since.
          <br>
          <br>
          I feel that what I do outside of the classroom sets me apart from other applicants, so
          I have put together the following portfolio of projects to suppliment my resume. Thank you for
          considering me as an applicant.

          <h1>Logex Prototyping Board</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          During my freshman year of college, I found a need to build permenant prototypes to test
          digital logic circuits. Existing protoboards were often poor quality and difficult to use,
          so I designed one specifically to address the challenges of building dense digital circuits.
          <br>
          <br>
          After using them extensively for personal projects, I decided to launch a Kickstarter
          campaign and sell the boards commercially. Over 300 boards were sold in the first
          three weeks of fundraising and the project is over 270% funded.
          <br>
          <br>
          More information can be found on the Kickstarter campaign linked below:

          <h1>A New Gas Chromatograph</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          This year, I was invited to work with Dr. Robert Senter in the LMU Chemistry
          Department on a new type of gas chromatograph detector (shown in top image). Rather than the expensive thin-filament
          RTDs used in many teaching lab instruments, our system is based on the V/T relationship of a diode
          when current is held constant.
          <br>
          <br>
          In addition to designing the sensor driver and small signal amplifier, I also modified an old gas chromatograph
          (shown in bottom image) for use with our new sensor.
          <br>
          <br>
          The diode detectors we have built have many advantages that make them uniquely suited for use in
          a teaching lab. They are rugged, do not require helium as a carrier gas, and inexpensive to make
          and use.

          <h1>Robotic Bartender</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Development of this project can be broken into two major versions. Version 1 was built around an an Arduino
          Uno and was able to mix up to 6 ingredients at a time. It also supported individual passcodes for access
          control.
          <br>
          <br>
          Version 2, shown in the attached pictures at two different stages of development, is based on the Intel Curie SOC
          and can mix up to 10 ingredients. It also offers users the option to carbonate the entire beverage in a CNC-milled
          pre-dispensing chamber.
          <br>
          <br>
          Recipies for Version 2 are defined using an accompanying Mac desktop app (which I wrote in Swift). Each user is able
          to create a local account using any card with a magnetic stripe as their unique user ID.
          After swiping a card associated with an account, recipes can be created and saved by moving sliders around.
          Volume dispensed under each account is recorded so that guests can be charged appropriately at the end of the event.
          <br>
          <br>
          This project taught me most of what I know about CNC machining and C/C++ programming. All parts, software, and circuit designs
          are completely original.

          <h1>OneWire for Arduino</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          This was actually a motor interface controller I designed for Version 1 of the robotic bartender to make better use of the limited
          I/O ports on the Arduino Uno. It allows one microcontroller output pin to control up to 31 output devices by automatically detecting incomming
          serial data and writing it to a bank of four 74HC595 shift registers.
          <br>
          <br>
          After the first prototype was successful, I decided to design and order a PCB (shown in bottom picture). The project was discontinued
          when I found integrated circuits that implement a similar communication protocol, but I learned a lot from designing my own solution.

        </header>
        <p>
          As a college student, I can't afford to buy lab-grade instruments for personal use. To get around this,
          I frequently buy broken or defective instruments (oscilliscopes, DMMs, LC meters, etc.) on eBay with
          the intention of fixing and calibrating them for personal use (or resale). I have accumulated nearly a complete
          set of old Tektronix instruments that I have used extensively when testing out new designs.
          <br>
          <br>
          The instrument shown on the right is a 1969 Tektronix 453 oscilloscope that I fixed a couple months
          ago. Despite being 50 years old, it is an amazing piece of technology and has become my favorite tool
          for working on old electonic equipment, especially high voltage vacuum tube circuits.

          <h1>Breadboard Nixie Tubes</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Freshman year of college, I became fascinated with old style numeric displays (nixie tubes),
          and bought several to experiment with. To get the 160 VDC needed to drive them, I built a simple
          buck-boost converter from a topology published online. I used the only inductors and capacitors
          I had on hand and programmed an Arduino to control the switching until I found a frequency that worked.
          I then replaced the Arduino with a 555 timer configured to switch at the same frequency (shown in picture).
